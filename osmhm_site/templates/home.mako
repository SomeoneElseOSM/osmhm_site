<p>OpenStreetMap Hall Monitor is a passive monitoring tool for OSM, scouring hourly diffs in search of suspicious behavior. Tracking for specific objects or users is in development, as are additional "red flags" for suspicious changesets. Get started by clicking "Watch List" since that's all that's functioning at the moment. Also, the app may have been put to sleep, so give it a few minutes and refresh the watch list after first loading if the last update time is old.</p>
<p>This tool is only to be used diagnostically.</p>
