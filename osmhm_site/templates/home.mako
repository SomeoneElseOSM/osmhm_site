<p>OpenStreetMap Hall Monitor is a passive monitoring tool for OSM, scouring hourly diffs in search of suspicious behavior. Tracking for specific objects or users has been completed (including the use of wildcards), and "red flags" for suspicious changesets are in development. Get started by logging in! If you have not been added to the system (i.e. you cannot see links to user or object monitoring at the time), send me a message <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/FTA">on OSM</a> or <a href="mailto:ethan-nelson@users.noreply.github.com">via email</a>.</p>
<p>This tool is only to be used diagnostically.</p>
